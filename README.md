# Noncommutative Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Conjecture 
A Python code for the Noncommutative Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Conjecture. The conjecture is shown to be false for m=5 and n=5. While m=4 is correct at least for all n = 4, 5, 6 and all multiples of 4. 

The details of implementation are from the paper: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/lai20a/lai20a.pdf

The SDP solver is using CVXPY. It is simple to adapt the code for other cases, but m=6 or larger will not be possible.
